The UAE retail market is dominated by two major retailers who have
a strong grip on all manufacturers and suppliers. They control a lion’s
share of the market and their position continues to strengthen with
time, as they incorporate increasingly more unhealthy practices to
control and subjugate manufacturers and suppliers.

## Market Share of Major retailers  in UAE

---

 Retailer                    | Market share 2017   | Market share 2020 |     |
----------------------- | ------- | ----- | --- |
Carrefour       | 23% | 28% |     |
 LULU Lulu Emak Group        | 19% | 22% |     |
Spinny Spinneys | 6%  | 9%   |     |
 Union Coop           |4% | 8%  |     |
 Sharjha Coop  | 5% | 6%  |     |

The consequences of this oligopoly held by the top 2 retailers severely impact the
rest of the market

- Barrier to entry for new companies and new products

* Brand value erosion owing to price fluctuations and promo abuse

* Rampant market dumping of unregulated products (private labels & cheap imports)stant changes to contractual terms & conditions tailored to benefit the retailers only

* Long payment cycles, reduced cash flow and unhealthy return policy(especially during the pandemic)

While these practices have been perpetuated by the top 2 retailers, these are being
adopted by the mid to large sized retailers as well. The cascading of these unhealthy
practices and the continuous increase of pressure has reached a point where
manufacturers and suppliers have exhausted their earnings and patience.

It is a sad state of affairs that while the overall F&B grocery market has been growing
in UAE, the manufacturers and suppliers of F&B products are increasingly running in
losses and shutting shop or relying on exports to other markets and denied access to
the UAE consumers.




>There has been a continuous decline in
investment, innovation and interest in the sector and the industry is now at a point
where this will get even more drastic.

## No Real Prices

Post the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the UAE government implemented price
control measures to prevent companies from increasing prices arbitrarily. The
objective of this price control mechanism was to protect consumers.


1. However, the on-ground reality today is that
   - Manufacturers/ suppliers are unable to change prices
   - RSP (recommended selling price) suggested by manufacturers is ignored
   - Retailers decide prices (up or down) as per their business requirements
   - Prices vary from store to store and time to time (even within the same chain of retailers)- Heavy discounts are advertised by retailers — but consumers still end up
paying more

The current redressal system in place that manufacturers have at their disposal is
inadequate, cumbersome and skewed in favour of the retailers:
 * Manufacturers cannot contest the price of products sold in store
 * To contest this, they need to request an approval from the Ministry of Economy to justify price increase (based on changing costs of production, human
resources, inflation, global prices, etc.)
 * Correct decisions are seldom made because there is no transparent price
monitoring mechanism available
 * Price monitoring is isolated to the final price being sold by retailers without
consideration for input and marketing costs of manufacturers/ suppliers

>As a result, effectively, there is no price control
happening in the market as manufacturers & consumers
are both subject to the diktat of the big retailers and
must comply with the prices that they deem fit.


## Cascading Impact of this situation

Cascading Impact of this situation

This is a global phenomenon across developed countries — where large retail chains
control a very high share of the overall grocery markets. As mentioned earlier, UAE
is a market where >50% of the market is dominated by two retailers. And if we
add the Coops into the mix, there are 5 retail chains that control >70% of the

grocery market.

It has been well documented that the consequence of this high concentration of
grocery market share gives these retailers unprecedented bargaining power over the
suppliers and consumers. When control is skewed towards one entity, the impact on
the other key stakeholders, supplier & consumer, is as follows:



Retailer Abuse                             |Impact on Supplier                 |
------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
High listing fees to just allow representation on shelf  |            Additional cost to supplier, Risk of stocking largely on supplier 
Threat of delisting if suppliers refuse high retailer costs, a form of black-mail or retribution   |High business uncertainty Inability to plan business No bargaining power Substantial loss of volume
Visibility support fees just to have fair share of shelf and in-store visibility|Unnecessary business expense No risk for retailer,business risk solely on supplier
Marketing support costs for marketing, store openings, renovations, retailer promos, packaging, etc.| Additional costs without commensurate earnings ,Risk of retailer initiatives borne by supplier



To summarise, the impact of big retail on suppliers is as follows:

Complete risk of retailer’s business, initiatives and forecasting
errors borne by supplier

Loss of volume, profitability and visibility
Additional costs without commensurate earnings
Non-visibility of financial and business planning
High business uncertainty

-Impacted cash flow

-Potential to impact price and quality

-Loss of IP rights

-Disincentivising innovation

-Distortion of brand value and consumer perception of product

-No bargaining power
