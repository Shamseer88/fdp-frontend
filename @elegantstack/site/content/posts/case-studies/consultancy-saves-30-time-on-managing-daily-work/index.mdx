## Overview

Since the implementation of Excise Tax, Beverage companies have
observed a 25-30% decline in business. The indirect impact is much
higher and has a cascading effect on various aspects of the business.

Now the impact of COVID 19 is going to have an additional 20-25%
impact on businesses across the board. Coupled with the Excise
impact, businesses are suffering losses upwards of 50%.

If there is no resolution to this matter, many local companies would
not be able to sustain and will be forced to close down. Collectively,
these companies have invested billions of dirhams into the economy
over the last few years in manufacturing, distribution, marketing &
CSR activities.

Moreover, these companies collectively employ thousands of
employees. In a situation of companies closing down, it would impact
the families of all those whose livelihoods is dependent on the
beverages industry. The cascading effect will directly impact tens of
thousands of the population, if not more.
