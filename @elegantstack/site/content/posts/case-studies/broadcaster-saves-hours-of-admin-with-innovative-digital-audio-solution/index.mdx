## Unregulated imports stifling local
“Made in UAE" businesses

Local businesses are being pushed out of their own market. A cursory
look at the retail environment will reveal that UAE products are
provided with minimal shelf space. Support to local produce is not
being taken seriously and put into effect as even shelves dedicated for
local produce have imported products occupying space.

Cheap imports, across food categories, are entering our market while
circumventing regulatory requirements. Often times, these imports
are non-compliant and unhealthy foods which is a disservice to our
population. While UAE produce are subject to stringent standards that
are costly and complex. Imported products are able to price their way
into the market without such overheads.

is to “Make it in the Emirates” - the industry is ready
and geared to push forward, but require help and
support from the policy makers.

## Nothing is “Made in UAE” anymore

With the mandate to collectively achieve the Five Pillars of the National Food Security Strategy, one of the
methods of achieving this would be to wean the country off the import dependency on food items. This was one
of the key concerns of the industry and government at the onset of the pandemic.

Unfortunately, in our retail research, we identified a very small proportion of shelf space dedicated to UAE
products - across F&B categories, across 15 different outlets. Even on shelves dedicated to local produce,
imported products were occupying pride of place.

Retail Type | Shelves with UAE Produce |Total Food Shelves | % of UAE Produce
----------------------- | ------- | ----- | --- |
Big 2 |661 |4,748 |14%
Coops| 655| 4,698| 14%
Other chains| 727 |4,190| 17%

>The pandemic showed us that the local industry has the capacity and
capability to sustain the F&B needs of the resident population of UAE.
When global supply chains were severely disrupted and food supply
was a serious risk, the industry stepped up and were able to supply
produce across food categories.

However, as we return to a semblance of normalcy in this “new normal”, the old tendencies of pushing the sales
of private labels and cheap imports have also returned. With the severe financial impact of the pandemic, a
resumption of old methods is bringing the industry to a point of serious concern with severe withdrawal of
some much-needed investment and impetus to the economy.

UAE is a major export and logistics hub of the world owing to its unique geographical location and high
investments in infrastructure, and thus able to attract the best products and producers of food in the world.


But this advantage has manifested itself into a whole different dimension:

- As evidenced, imported products constitute >80% of shelf space across retail and food
categories.
- Local players are being pushed out of their own market and struggling to survive.
- Retailers support lower cost imported products as they generate higher profits.
- No support nor protection accorded to the local industry.
- Essentially, market competitiveness has become artificially structured towards favouring
imports and discouraging exports and local production.

The exclusion of local products is not only because of imported products. Some retailers play a more active
role in diminishing the performance of local players by promoting their in-store private labels:


>The casualties from this are not just local
manufacturers who have been helping build UAE's
economy since the 1970s, but the efforts of agri-tech
farms are also going in vain. Furthermore, the efforts
of young entrepreneurs with hopes to shape our
future is becoming needlessly more cumbersome as
the barriers to enter the market are sometime
insurmountable.
